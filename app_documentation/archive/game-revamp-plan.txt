  - UI/UX (core)
  - Basic Leaderboard

- **Phase 2: Engagement Boost**
  - Mini-Games & Daily Engagements
  - Power-Ups & Boosters
  - Glam Cave Expansion
  - Daily/Weekly Quests

**Dependencies:**
- Backend infrastructure, DB, and user auth must be in place before gameplay, economy, and cosmetics.
- Core gameplay and economy must be functional before adding mini-games, power-ups, and social features.
- Social features (families, PvP, leaderboards) depend on user accounts, economy, and core gameplay.
- Savings account and prestige depend on stable economy and progression systems.
- $MAMA integration is last, after all in-game tracking is robust.

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk                        | Mitigation Strategy                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low Player Retention        | Diverse content, daily quests, social, regular updates, engaging persona           |
| Boring Gameplay             | Varied chores, dynamic events, new mini-games, evolving Yo Mama                    |
| Server Performance Issues   | Redis caching, optimized queries, load testing, server-side validation             |
| Cheating/Exploits           | Server validation, rate limiting, anomaly detection, reporting, fast patching      |
| Economy Imbalance           | Careful MP sink/source design, DB-configurable params, monitoring, tuning          |
| Player Burnout (Airdrop)    | Fun core loop, clear comms, regular updates, avoid over-promising                  |
