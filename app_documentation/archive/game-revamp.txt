Okay, this is a significant pivot! Moving away from blockchain (for now) and NFTs (for now) changes the immediate implementation focus but keeps the fun core alive. We'll emphasize in-game currency, cosmetics, and a robust backend to track everything for that future airdrop.

Let's revamp "ClickyoMama" with these new parameters, focusing on variety, addictive loops, and an energetic feel, with all game parameters designed to be configurable from your Supabase DB and potentially cached/managed with Redis.

2. In-Game Economy & Future $MAMA Airdrop
Primary In-Game Currency

Name: Mama Points (MP)

Acquisition:

Clicking the primary target.

Completing "Chores" (dynamic click objectives).

Winning PvP Click-Offs.

Mini-game rewards.

Key Principle: The more you engage and earn in-game now, the larger your potential future $MAMA airdrop.

DB Config (Supabase): User table with total_accumulated_mp, last_activity_timestamp.

Primary Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL).

User accounts, inventory (cosmetics, MP), progression, family data, quest status, referral data, prestige levels, savings account deposits.

Caching & Real-time Features: Redis.

Leaderboards (Sorted Sets).

Session Management.

Rate Limiting.

Real-time presence for Family chat/members online (Pub/Sub).

Caching frequently accessed game parameters (chore lists, power-up stats, shop prices).

Temporary data like active power-up timers for users.

Hosting: Vercel (for frontend and Supabase functions).

Push Notifications (Optional, Future): For offline earnings ready, family event starting, etc. (e.g., using Supabase Functions with a service like OneSignal).

DB Configuration Management

Create dedicated tables in Supabase (e.g., game_parameters, chore_definitions, power_up_stats, cosmetic_items, quest_templates).

A simple admin interface (e.g., built with Retool, or directly via Supabase Studio) for game designers/admins to tweak these values without code changes.

Supabase Functions will read these parameters. Cache heavily in Redis with appropriate TTLs, and use Redis Pub/Sub or a webhook mechanism to invalidate cache when parameters are updated in Supabase.

15. Roadmap & Milestones (Revised)
Phase	Quarter	Key Deliverables	Focus
Phase 1: MVP Launch	QX 2024	Core Clicker, Mama Points, Basic Upgrades, Daily Login Streaks, Yo Mama Persona (Basic Animations & Roasts), Supabase/Redis Backend, User Accounts, First 3 Cosmetics (1 Mama Skin, 1 Theme, 1 Button), Basic Leaderboard (Total MP).	Get the core loop fun & stable.
Phase 2: Engagement Boost	QX+1 2024	"Mama's Chores" System, First 2 Mini-Games, Power-Ups (2-3 types), Mystery Boxes (Common/Uncommon), Glam Cave V1 (more cosmetics), Daily/Weekly Quests.	Variety, short-term goals, personalization.
Phase 3: Social & Competitive Core	QX+2 2024	Families (Clans) V1 (create, join, chat, basic perk), PvP "Click-Off Duels," Referral Program V1, Prestige System V1, "Savings Account" V1.	Community, competition, long-term goals.
Phase 4: Content Expansion & Polish	QX+3 2024	More Mini-Games, Advanced Power-Ups/Boosters, Expanded Glam Cave (more rarity tiers), Family Events, Seasonal Leaderboards, Advanced Yo Mama Animations/Moods.	Depth, polish, replayability.
Phase 5: Future Proofing & $MAMA Prep	QY 2025	Begin technical investigation for $MAMA token integration, smart contract development (if pursued), community building around future airdrop, physical merch exploration.	Prepare for potential blockchain pivot.
16. Risk Mitigation (Revised)
Risk	Mitigation
Low Player Retention	Diverse mini-games, daily quests, streaks, social features (Families, PvP), frequent content updates (cosmetics, events), engaging Yo Mama persona, clear long-term prestige goals.
Boring/Repetitive Gameplay	Introduce "Mama's Chores" for varied interactions, dynamic events, new mini-games regularly, evolving Yo Mama character.
Server Performance Issues	Leverage Redis for caching and real-time, optimize Supabase queries, server-side validation, load testing before major feature releases.
Cheating/Exploits	Server-side validation for all critical actions, rate limiting, anomaly detection, community reporting. Quick patching of identified exploits.
Economy Imbalance (MP)	Careful design of MP sinks (cosmetics, upgrades, PvP entries) and sources. Monitor MP inflation. DB-configurable parameters allow for tuning.
Player Burnout Before Future Airdrop	Keep the core game fun and engaging on its own. Communicate clearly about the potential future airdrop without over-promising timelines. Regular dev updates and community engagement.
Scalability of Supabase/Redis	Monitor usage, optimize queries and data structures. Supabase and Redis are generally scalable but require good architecture.

This revamped PRD for "ClickyoMama" focuses on building a highly engaging, customizable, and fun web-based clicker game, with the clear understanding that all in-game achievements (Mama Points) are recorded for a potential future $MAMA token airdrop. The emphasis on DB-configurable parameters will give you immense flexibility in tuning the game post-launch. Let's get clicking!
